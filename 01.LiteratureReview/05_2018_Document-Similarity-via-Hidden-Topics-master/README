This is the repository for paper "Document Similarity for Texts of Varying Lengths via Hidden Topics" to appear in ACL 2018.
This is a system implemented by Hongyu Gong in python for matching long documents and short documents (e.g. summary).

Structure:
src/ is the source code of the document matching system.
concept-project-mapping-dataset/ prepares the data for the task of concept-project matching.=


Required package:
a) gensim
b) sklearn
c) nltk
1. Input data format
raw_short_docs: a list of strings where each string is the abstract;
raw_long_docs: a list of strings where each string is a long document;

2. Run main.py
- Set hyperparameters properly (the default parameters are what we used in the paper);
- Specify the path of word embeddings.
- You need to write function to read data into specified format. You can refer to the function readData()in test.py.
Return: The function mapping() in main.py will return a score matrix, and the (i,j)-th entry in the matrix is the matching score of the i-th short document and the j-th long document. 
Note that the score is a real value between 0 and 1. The higher the score is, the better they match each other.

<b> Note that you can run test.py which returns matching scores for the project-concept pairs.</b>


Furthermore, we provide science-domain corpara extracted from the WikiCorpus, which are used to train science-domain embeddings:
(1) [science_corpus_d2](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BIyKO9xMqpNOO7EordP9_kS0Zr2tIiNx): a refined corpus of 90 MB consists of documents within depth of 2 in science categories;
(2) [science_corpus_d3](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xsJymoKZi2Fr2SCTDwSJzZid13Lp7PO4): a larger corpus of 2GB consists of documents within depth of 3 in science categories.
